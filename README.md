# CLI Todo List

A simple yet powerful command-line Todo List application written in Go. This application allows users to manage their tasks with user authentication, priority levels, and data persistence.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Create accounts and log in securely
- **Todo Management**: Add, edit, delete, and mark todos as complete
- **Priority Levels**: Assign priority levels (1-4) to your tasks
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded priorities and completion status
- **Data Persistence**: Todos and user data are saved between sessions
- **User-specific Todos**: Each user can only view and manage their own todos
